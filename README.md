# Automated Firewall Rule Management with PowerShell

This project focuses on creating a PowerShell script for efficient management of firewall rules on Windows Server 2022. The script will allow users to list existing rules, create new rules, modify rules, and remove rules. The goal is to automate the firewall rule configuration process, enhancing security measures and streamlining administration tasks.

## Key Features:

Listing Rules: Retrieve and display a comprehensive list of current firewall rules to provide an overview.

Creating Rules: Generate new firewall rules with specified parameters, such as display name, direction, action, protocol, local port, and remote address.

Modifying Rules: Update existing firewall rules by adjusting parameters like action or local port to meet changing security requirements.

Removing Rules: Remove obsolete or redundant firewall rules to maintain a clean and efficient rule set.

Benefits:

Efficiency: Automate repetitive tasks related to firewall management, reducing manual effort and potential human errors.

Security Enhancement: Ensure that firewall rules align with current security policies and promptly adapt to changing requirements.

Script Reusability: The PowerShell script can be reused across different environments or servers, promoting consistency in rule configurations.
